This assignment required me to implement a simple file transfer application. It had to be able to handle missed packets, ARQ protocols, out of order packets, corrupted packets, etc.

All network communication is done through NetEmu, the setup of which can be found under NetEmu/. I did not write the NetEmu code, that was provided for the assignment.
